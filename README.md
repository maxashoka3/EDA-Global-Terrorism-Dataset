# EDA-Global-Terrorism-Dataset
This is the EDA project of the Global Terrorism Dataset where it contains the records from 1970 to 2017. This dataset is maintained by University of Maryland. It has Global terrorism record more than 180K This EDA project has explore the Global Terrorism Dataset as much as possible. 
## Objective Of EDA:
* To Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Global Terrorism Datasets
* Find the hot zone of Terrorism
* Security issue raised by EDA
* Data-Driven Solution 

### Steps involved in this project:

* Data Summary

* Data Cleaning

* Story telling Visualization

* Challenges faced

* Data Driven Solution

* Conclusions


## Story telling through Visualization: 
We have done ultiple manupulaiton and done multiple visualization based on the need of the special charts to discover the pattern and trends. We have used heatmap, bar graph with single axis and with twin axis, single line graph and multiple line graph, Pie Chart, Area Graph, pair plot and so on.
## Challenges faced
* Handling huge dataset

* Handling a huge number of unique value

* Handling of the Nan values and Inappropriate values

* Selection of the specific column as most of the columns are not correlated with each other 

* Decoding the  ‘Unknown’ field’ was challenging as we don’t have a subject matter expert.
## Data Driven Solution

Solution based on EDA:-
* Developed countries need to bring refugees from the most affected countries. Because a city like Baghdad has more attacks than the whole world combined. 
* Explosives and guns need to be controlled & Monitored
* Explosive and gun detection systems need to be implemented 
* Bunker should be made in public areas
* Most affected countries need to adopt modern technology
* Should make a strong network of the spy to monitor them and try to stop the future attack
* Implementation of more military personnel and security in the most affected cities
* Needs cooperation from the neighbouring and developed countries
* Need to conduct the bilateral Talk with the Terrorist Gangs
 
## Conclusion
The withdrawn conclusion are :
1. Terrorist attack has been increasing since 1970 but in 2012 attacks increased exponentially
 
2. Baghdad is the hotspot of terrorism as it has the most number of attacks in the entire world.
 
3. Iraq is the country with the most number of Attack happens mainly due to the Taliban, and also responsible for several casualties i.e Killed wounded and damaged 
 
4. Middle East & North Africa is the most affected region. 
 
5. Year with the most attacks is 2014 and the most active month is 5 i.e May and Day is 15
 
6. Most used weapons are Explosive and Arms Assault among which 50% of the attacker has used explosive weapon to attack and about 58.3 % of casualty has been by Bombing/Explosion ArmAsult has also been used to kill and wound the people
7. But in countries like El Salvador and the Philippines Arm Assault has been used as the main weapon wherein Hijacking & Assassination contribute less.
8. Most targeted is private Citizens & Property such as unarmed man, mall, roads etc
9. Most active Terrorist Gangs is the Taliban which is from Afghanistan
10. After 1977, terrorist attacks started in India and skyrocketed in 2008 and went to peak in the year 2016
11. Srinagar is the most affected city in India
12. In Russia and Ukraine, the attacks started to increase from the year 2014 due to the annexation of the Cremia.
14. In SAARC countries Pakistan, Afghanistan and India seem to have more terrorist attacks than the rest of the SAARC countries.
15. Total number of Terrorist groups is  3537
